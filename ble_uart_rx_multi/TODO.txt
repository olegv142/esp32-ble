1. Implement commands / status messages as follows:
Commands (ends with \r or \n):
  '#Cn addr'  - connect n-th stream to addr
  '#R'        - reset to idle state
Optionally, commands may begin with an 8-bit checksum, expressed in hexadecimal,
starting with the prefix ~. So the command starts with ~hh#
Status messages:
  ':I vmaj.vmin' - idle, not connected
  ':Cn'     - connecting to the n-th peer
  ':D'      - data receiving from connected peers
  ':Sn rssi - RSSI report for n-th peer

2. Start every out message with \1 end with \0. Second symbol is ':' for status messages
  or '0', '1' .., 'A', 'B', ..  for data stream 0, 1, .. (up to 31)

3. The first data message after connection / re-connection has no data payload.
   This is the stream start token.
