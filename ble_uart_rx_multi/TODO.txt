1. Start every out message with \1 end with \0. Second symbol is ':' for status messages
  or '0', '1' .., 'A', 'B', ..  for conn[0], conn[1] .. data (max 32)
2. Implement commands / status messages as follows:
Commands (ends with \r or \n):
  '#S Dev0 Dev1 ..' - scan for devices given their names
  '#C'              - connect to detected devices
  '#C Adr0 Adr1 ..' - connect to the given device addresses
  '#R'              - reset
Optionally, commands may begin with an 8-bit checksum, expressed in hexadecimal,
starting with the prefix ~. So the command starts with ~hh#
Status messages:
  ':I'               - idle, just initialized
  ':E'               - error state (no device detected in scan or no device connected)
  ':S'               - scanning
  ':R[!failed_mask]' - scan done, ready to connect
  ':C#<n>'           - connecting to the n-th peer
  ':D[!failed_mask]' - data receiving from peers
  If failed_mask is present its the bitmask of the peer devices
  specified in scan start command or connect addresses that was
  not detected in scan or failed to connect to.
